# Handheld Prototyping Script

Just a simple QML script for generating a image of a QWERTY handheld device in a scale of 1mm = 1px.

Because it's QML, it's really easy to change whatever is needed and take advantage of QML's layouting functionality.

To run, either open the .qmlproject file in QtCreator or run `qmlscene keyboard.qml`.
